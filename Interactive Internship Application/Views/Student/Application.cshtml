        <h2>Professional Conduct Expectations</h2>
        <br>
        <p>An academic internship is an opportunity to live, learn, and lead. As a business professional, the internship should be viewed from the standpoint
            of employment in terms of the level of commitment. This means that regardless of whether the internship is paid or unpaid the student will have 
            the same regard for the experience because it is a "professional" position. Employment is considered a binding agreement between an employer and 
            employee. Internships should be seen as a binding agreement also. Students will abide by company policies regarding appropriate dress, professional
            conduct, safety, customer service, and moral and ethical behavior. In addition students should display a professional work ethic which include:
            <ul>
                <li>Be on time and be prepared for all interviews. If you agree to interview for a position, you are expeced to follow through with the 
                    interview and be professionally dressed and prepared to answer questions. It is NOT appropriate to just miss an interview. IF an 
                    emergency arises, call the interviewer, tell them what happened, and ask if it is possible to reschedule.</li>
                <li>Be courteous and thoughtful-- Take nothing for granted and always show appreciation for any given opportunity. Send thank you notes
                    after interviews, and at the beginning and end of the internship.</li>
                <li>Be at work as scheduled-- Absentees should be avoided at all costs and reserved for "dire" emergencies only. You should notify your
                    employer as soon as possible of anying scheduling issues, preferably 24 hours in advance or according to the company's policies. You do
                    not miss work to handle course assignments. Other appointments should be scheduled around your work schedule.</li>
                <li>Be on time for work and meetings-- Timeliness is critical to career success, lateness is not an option. You may even arrive early to 
                    show initiative.</li>
                <li>Meet deadlines-- All work assignments should be completed on time regardless of how "mundane" they may appear (without exception).</li>
                <li>Seek clarification as needed-- Always seek the appropriate supervisor when in doubt. Do not make any major decisions without first 
                    seeking advice. Do not complete a work assignment that you are unsure of. Ask for clarification.</li>
                <li>Dress to impress-- Dress appropriately for the work environment. Most companies require business or business casual attire. If in doubt 
                    ask for information regarding the company dress policy, (no sneakers, T-shirts, or spike heels with bare legs please)!</li>
                <li>Exhibit Emotional Intelligence at all times-- Mind your manners and manage your emotions. Self-control is the key; understand how you 
                    impact others and be aware of your non-verbal cues. Always seek to understand and then be understood (Steven Covey).</li>
                <li>Get your foot in the door-- This is a perfect opportunity to land a full-time position or secure an outstanding reference. Make good
                    use of it.</li>
            </ul>
